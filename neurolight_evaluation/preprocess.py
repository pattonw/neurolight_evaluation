    In the case you are matching a graph G to a tree T, it
    may be the case that G does not contain a subgraph isomorphic
    to G. If you want to prevent failure, you can augment G with T,
    so that there is always a solution, just matching T to T.
    However with sufficient penalties assigned to this matching,
    we can make matching T to T, a last resort, that will only be
    used if matching G to T is impossible.

    Take every branch node, b, and split it into d nodes
    where d = degree(b). the nodes b_i create the complete
    graph K_d, and each b_i has 1 aditional edge to a
    neighbor of b.

    ground truth G:
       d
    a--b--c
       e
    and predicted graph T:
    x--y--z
    Then adding G as a fallback to T gives y 3 adjacent edges,
    (xy, yz, yb), however to match to b, a node needs degree at
    least 4. Thus we rely on the fallback, regardless of how close
    y is. This means also that only one of the edges(xy or yz) can
    successfully match to (ab or bc) respectively, simply due to
    the number of edges between b and y being 1.
